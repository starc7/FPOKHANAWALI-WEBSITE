          <br />
        </strong>
        The ownership of the FPO is with its members. It is an organization of
        the producers, by the producers and for the producers. One or more
        institutions and/or individuals may have promoted the FPO by way of
        assisting in mobilization, registration, business planning and
        operations. However, ownership control is always with members and
        management is through the representatives of the members.

        <br />
        Who provides support for promotion of FPO?

        from procurement of raw material to delivery of the final product at the
        ultimate consumers’ doorstep. In brief, the PO could undertake the
